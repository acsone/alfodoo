+Alfodoo is a set of addons to seamlessly integrate an external Document
+Management System with Odoo.
+
+Alfresco Enterprise Content Management System (from version 4.2) is supported.
+
+The code is structured in two parts:
+
+- pure CMIS 1.1 compliant modules (cmis_field, cmis_web)
+- Alfresco specific extension modules (cmis_alf, cmis_web_alf).
+
+It is therefore possible in principle to easily integrate Other CMIS compliants
+content management systems such as Nuxeo, Documentum, etc. This has not been tested yet.
+
+Documentation and installation instructions can be found at https://alfodoo.org.
