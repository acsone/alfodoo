Roadmap
#######

* Manage versions when a document is uploaded (selection between minor or major version, add comment information) 
* Display document versions: Preview/download of a specific version of an item. Preview of the item associated properties
* Edit offline (item check-out & locking)/Update a new version/Cancel editing (document unlock)
* Edit online (with MS Office suite)
* Folder suppression: synchronization between the odoo record and the linked alfresco folder
* Some sort of document type management.
* Some sort of meta-data synchronization
* Some sort of cmis-link widget to link to a specific cmis document/version in an Odoo form
* Some kind of integration between Odoo e-mailing and Alfresco
* Fork/Replace cmislib. cmislib is a library managed by Apache Chemistry. Despite several attempts to contribute (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CMIS-972, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CMIS-979, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CMIS-971), it seems very difficult to make it evolve even if the problems are blockers. This situation forces us to use our own fork of that library.
