          This module allows to store attachments with CMIS from the mail composer if the source model has at least one CMIS folder.
          When attachments are added on the mail composer, a checkbox allows to enable the CMIS storage. If the source model has more than one CMIS folder,
          it is possible to specify in which one the attachments must be stored.
